This is a fun project!

When it is finished some day (if it all) it will be a Minecraft bot that can
do various tasks on a Minecraft server.

At the moment it is mainly driven by http://dsource.org/projects/minid and hence
based on the D programming language. But it will eventually be ported to C++ (ugh),
when MiniD has completely been ported to C++.

It is for some parts inspired by Mineflayer but i'm trying to make extensive
use of MiniD's awesome features.
